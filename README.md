# Kadzen

v1.0

"Kadzen" is a Shoot Them All game with randomly generated levels.

Players must navigate through a labyrinth, searching for a button to unlock the door to the next level. In order to progress, they must strategically use TNT to destroy door, walls and robots. To aid in their mission, players can collect useful items scattered throughout the levels or purchase them in the Z.NET store.

Use lighter to start game.

More TNT - more FUN!

HINT: 'W' or '↑' - up, 'A' or '→'' - right, 'D' '←' - left, 'S' '↓' - down, SPACE' - TNT.

Made with LÖVE and some self-made libraries on top of the engine.
